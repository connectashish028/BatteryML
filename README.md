## Purpose

The goal is to predict the capacity of a battery over time using machine learning, focusing on identifying key factors affecting battery performance. The developed model aims to improve the management, lifespan, and safety of battery-powered systems.

## Workflow

The project's workflow is organized into several key steps:

1. **Data Loading:** Importing the dataset from an Excel file.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, selecting relevant features, and transforming the data for modeling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data to uncover underlying patterns and relationships.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features to enhance model performance.
5. **Modeling:** Training and validating different machine learning models to predict battery capacity.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the models using performance metrics and selecting the best-performing model.
7. **Conclusions:** Summarizing findings and recommendations for further improvements.

## Methods Used

### Data Loading and Initial Exploration

* **Libraries:** Utilized pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for data manipulation and visualization.
* **Data:** The dataset contains 1255 records, with features such as Time[h], U[V], I[A], Ah[Ah], and Command.
* **Initial Exploration:** Analyzed dataset structure, types, missing values, and basic statistics.

### Data Cleaning

* **Feature Selection:** Key columns like Time[h], t-Step[h], U[V], I[A], Ah[Ah], and Command were selected for further analysis.
* **Missing Values:** Handled missing values appropriately (e.g., imputation, removal).

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* **Visualization:** Visualized distributions and relationships between key features using appropriate plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices).

### Feature Engineering

* **New Features:** Created new features (specific techniques not detailed) to improve model performance.

### Modeling

* **Models Tested:**
  * Linear Regression
  * Random Forest
  * Gradient Boosting
  * Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Used GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters.

### Model Evaluation

* **Metrics Used:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* **Results:**
  * Linear Regression: MAE: 0.535, MSE: 0.414
  * Random Forest: MAE: 0.355, MSE: 0.329
  * Gradient Boosting: MAE: 0.373, MSE: 0.299 (Best performance)
  * Support Vector Regressor: MAE: 0.427, MSE: 0.350
  * K-Nearest Neighbors: MAE: 0.633, MSE: 0.991

## Analysis and Results

### Data Exploration Findings

* The Ah[Ah] capacity metric showed a consistent decline over time, aligning with expected battery degradation patterns.
* Significant correlations were identified between voltage (U[V]), current (I[A]), and capacity.

### Feature Importance

Key predictors such as Time[h], U[V], and I[A] were likely identified as crucial for accurate capacity predictions.

### Model Performance

* **Best Model:** Gradient Boosting was identified as the best-performing model with the lowest MAE and MSE.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  * Random Forest: Best parameters: {'max_depth': None, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 300}
  * Gradient Boosting: Best parameters: {'learning_rate': 0.2, 'max_depth': 4, 'n_estimators': 200}

## Conclusions and Recommendations

* The Gradient Boosting model was the most effective for predicting battery capacity, demonstrating superior performance compared to other models.
* The model can be leveraged in battery management systems to provide accurate predictions of battery health and optimize performance.

**Recommendations for Further Work:**

* **Model Enhancement:** Experiment with deep learning models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to capture temporal dependencies more effectively.
* **Real-Time Application:** Implement the model in a real-time monitoring system for continuous battery management predictions.
* **Data Augmentation:** Collect additional data under varying conditions to improve model robustness and generalizability.
* **Feature Expansion:** Include external factors like temperature and load conditions, which significantly impact battery performance.
